SDK adjacent features to implement:

1. get statistics from match history: win rate total and win rate vs player_name
2. auto take all cards and accept trade with manatraders bot
3. wait for bot to take all cards and accept trade with manatraders bot
4. test opponent id
5. test challenge alarm 

Not SDK adjacent (can delegate to agent):
1. add outboard section to deckbuilder, idea is to add a sideboard guide builder, where we can make a table that says what we take out and what we board in each matchup
2. cross check deckbuilder with exported collection (can just make it check the latest json so it doesnt touch the export anymore)
