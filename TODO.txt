Features to Implement:

SDK-ADJACENT FEATURES (Require MTGO SDK Integration):
1. Auto-accept trades with Manatraders bot (take all cards)
2. Auto-accept trades with Manatraders bot (wait for bot to take all cards)
3. Advanced match statistics: win rate vs specific player name (currently only shows overall win rate)

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
1. Add type hints to all functions (currently ~60% coverage)
2. Extract MetagameService from metagame_analysis.py widget (see ARCHITECTURE.md)
3. Extract MatchHistoryService from match_history.py widget (see ARCHITECTURE.md)
4. Split deck_selector.py into focused controllers (see GitHub issues)
5. Increase test coverage to 65-70% (currently ~12-15%)
6. Configuration file support for MongoDB URI and other settings
7. Unified CacheManager class to replace scattered caching logic

COMPLETED FEATURES (No longer TODO):
✓ Sideboard guide builder with matchup-specific boarding plans
✓ Collection integration - cross-check decks with MTGO collection
✓ Match history with win rate statistics (overall and filtered by date)
✓ Opponent tracking and deck lookup
✓ Challenge timer alerts
